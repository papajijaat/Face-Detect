# Face-Detect
Simple program written in python for face detection using OpenCV

We will be using haar cascade classifier . 

Can read more about it at 
http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html

### How to run it ?  
    1. Open a terminal in the directory of this repo
    2. Run  python face_detect.py
 
### Results 
    A window will open accessing your webcam and a green box will appear around your face.
    

### Improvements
    Only works for the front face . New classifier can be trained to increase its efficiency to detect the face at different angles and orientation.
